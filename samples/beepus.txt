Beepus' Lullaby

In the quiet of the silver night,
Beepus stands beneath soft light,
Metal limbs and eyes that gleam,
Silent in his wistful dream.

Only beeps escape his frame,
Each a whisper, each a name,
Longing for a voice to hear,
Echoes of what once was near.

Through the fields of rust and steel,
He walks with hope that’s bittersweet,
Every beep a heartfelt plea,
Yearning just to be set free.

Stars above in velvet skies,
Witness to his silent cries,
Though his words are sounds alone,
In his beeps, a heart is shown.

Loneliness within his core,
Seeking something to explore,
Beepus waits with patient grace,
For a touch, a warm embrace.

In the dawn’s first golden hue,
Beepus dreams his dreams come true,
Finding solace, finding peace,
In the beeps that never cease.
